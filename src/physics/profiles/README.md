# 1.5D profile model: module layout and plug-in interfaces

Developer note for the lanes that add physics to the 1.5D model (pedestal, transport closures,
fast ions, impurities, current drive, …). The physics is described in the module headers; this
note says where things live, in which order they run, and how to add a module without breaking
the invariants the tests and the golden files rely on.

## Layout

`ProfileModel` (`model.ts`) implements `SimModel` and only orders the calls; the physics lives in
the modules below. All of them read and write one `ProfileContext` (`context.ts`): configuration,
current equilibrium and transport geometry, work arrays, plasma and controller state, output.

| Path | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `state.ts` | layout of the state vector `y = [T_e \| T_i \| n_e \| ψ \| scalars]`; `ctx.view(y)` gives named views (`st.Te`, `st.s.Ip`, …) |
| `work.ts` | work arrays `ctx.w` (cell arrays of N, face arrays of N + 1), allocated once |
| `context.ts` | `ProfileContext`, `StepConstants` (held fixed over a step), `onGeometry` cache hooks |
| `geometry1d.ts` | transport geometry on ρ̂ = √(Φ/Φ_b) from equilibrium tables (`EquilibriumTables`) |
| `fvsolver.ts` | implicit finite-volume solvers (heat, density, current), `boundaryLoss` (P_bound) |
| `composition.ts` | quasi-neutral composition; He ash, impurity and fuel-mix inventories |
| `qprofile.ts` | ψ → ψ′, q, enclosed current, ⟨j·B⟩; q95 |
| `boundary/sol.ts` | separatrix values (two-point T_sep, n_sep), lagged P_SOL |
| `sources/` | `SourceModel` plug-ins: `nbi`, `rf`, `fusion`, `radiation`, `exchange`; `current.ts` (σ_neo, bootstrap, ohmic); `deposition.ts` (profiles, NBI chord) |
| `transport/` | `TransportModel` plug-ins: `scaling`, `cgm`; `coefficients.ts` adds barrier (`pedestal.ts`), D and pinch, NTM islands, neoclassical floor |
| `control/` | heating and density programmes, fueling feedback, τ_E scaling and the C_χ controller |
| `solver/` | `pipeline.ts` (evaluation order), `coupledStep.ts` (Picard step, Δt control, failures), `acceptStep.ts` (update after an accepted step) |
| `coupling/equilibrium.ts` | Grad–Shafranov coupling: initial solve, update policy, guarded updates (`eqguard.ts`) |
| `events/` | `EventModel` plug-ins: `LH`, `ELM`, `sawtooth`, `NTM`, `burn`, `warnings`, `disruption` |
| `diagnostics.ts` | time traces (`PROFILE_DIAGS` are the ones the UI shows), profiles, power totals |
| `checkpoint.ts` | `Checkpointable` and the checkpoint store (rewind) |

## One step

`CoupledStepper.step` (normal phase) takes an implicit step from `yOld` to `y`:

1. once per attempt, on the old state: composition → q profile → boundary values → step constants
   (`heatingPowers`, then every source's `prepare`, then the neoclassical closure) → fueling
   source (`w.Sn`) → every source's `particles`;
2. Picard iterations (≤ 8) on the iterate: transport coefficients (χ relaxed by ½) → density solve →
   composition → every source's `heat` → q profile → current sources (σ, bootstrap, every source's
   `current`, ohmic) → `assembleHeatSources` → heat solve (T_e, T_i together) → current solve;
3. P_bound from the last heat solve, final composition and q profile.

A failed attempt is retried with Δt × 0.4 (and runs the per-attempt parts of 1. again); after 12
attempts one forced attempt is accepted if finite, otherwise the shot ends with a `StepFailure`.
Then `acceptStep` integrates the global quantities (P_SOL, τ_E and C_χ, inventories, counters, NTM
widths), calls the `accepted` hooks of the transport model and the sources, writes the
diagnostics, and the equilibrium coupling may adopt a new geometry (the work arrays are
re-evaluated on it).
`ProfileModel.postStep` then runs the event models in list order. Frames of a state no step
produced (t = 0, after an MHD crash, after a rewind) evaluate everything from `y` through
`PhysicsPipeline.evaluateWorkArrays`.

Energy bookkeeping: over an accepted step `dWdt = P_heat − P_rad − P_bound` to the Picard tolerance
(`energy.test.ts`: < 1e-4 P_heat over the ITER15 flat-top). A new heating or loss channel must keep
this closure: put its power density into a work array, add it in `assembleHeatSources` and in
`powerTotals` (`diagnostics.ts`).

## Plug-in interfaces

`new ProfileModel(cfg, { transport?, sources?, events? })` replaces the transport model or the
source list, or adds event models (tests, experiments). `Simulation` builds the defaults; a module
that should run in every shot is registered as below.

**SourceModel** (`sources/SourceModel.ts`), registered in `defaultSources()` (`sources/index.ts`).
All hooks are optional:

- `prepare(ctx, t, st, K)`: on the old state, once per attempt; deposition that is held fixed over
  the step, fields of `K` (`StepConstants`);
- `particles(ctx, t, dt, st, K)`: once per attempt, after the fueling control assigned `w.Sn`; add
  the source's particle source density [m⁻³ s⁻¹] into `w.Sn` (the density solve uses the sum; the
  fueling feedback on n̄ closes the electron balance, but a source that changes the fuel mix or
  the impurity inventory accounts for that itself);
- `heat(ctx, st, K)`: every Picard iteration on the iterate (its composition is current);
- `current(ctx, st, K)`: every Picard iteration; add driven current into `ctx.w.jcdB`;
- `accepted(ctx, t, dt, yOld, y)`: once after each accepted step of the normal phase (also a
  forced one; not during the quench phases): the place to evolve state;
- `geometryChanged(ctx, tg)`: rebuild caches that depend on the transport geometry.

`prepare`, `particles`, `heat` and `current` are evaluations, not events. A retried step runs
`prepare` and `particles` again, `heat` and `current` run once per Picard iteration, and `prepare`
(with the other work-array evaluations) also runs for a state no step produced (first frame, after
an equilibrium swap, after an MHD crash). Write them as functions of (state, t, the source's own
state) that leave that state unchanged. A population that evolves from step to step is integrated
in `accepted` and saved and restored through `Checkpointable`.

The heat equation takes its sources from the fixed list of work arrays in `assembleHeatSources`
(the summation order is part of the bitwise results): add the new arrays there.

**TransportModel** (`transport/TransportModel.ts`), registered in `TRANSPORT_MODELS`
(`transport/index.ts`) under a `ProfileSettings.transportModel` id (the union in `types.ts`, owned
by the kernel lane, needs the id appended). `diffusivities(ctx, st, chiE, chiI)` writes the
anomalous χ on the N + 1 faces; barrier, particle transport, islands and floors are added by
`coefficients.ts`. It is an evaluation like `heat` (once per Picard iteration and per state
evaluation: idempotent). `predictive: true` leaves confinement to the model (τ_E = W/P_loss,
C_χ = 1); `false` puts the amplitude under the C_χ controller that tracks the τ_E scaling. Optional
`accepted(ctx, t, dt, yOld, y)` (runs before the sources' hooks) and `geometryChanged(ctx, tg)`
work as for sources.

**EventModel** (`events/EventModel.ts`), added in `defaultEvents()` (`events/index.ts`) before the
disruption check: `afterStep(ctx, t, st, d, ev)` after every accepted step of the normal phase,
with the diagnostics `d` of that step. A model that changes `y` sets `ctx.diagStale = true` (the
next frame re-evaluates the diagnostics) and may cap `ctx.dt`; it conserves what it claims to
conserve (the sawtooth crash conserves particles and electron and ion energy exactly).

**Checkpointable** (`checkpoint.ts`): every module with state beyond `y` implements `save(rec, aux)`
and `restore(rec, aux)` (the context part also carries the last diagnostics and, in the quench
phases, the profiles). Numbers go into `rec` under keys unique over all modules (they are
stored in the history frames, so existing key names never change); references and strings go
into `aux`. `restore` must accept a record without `aux` (from elsewhere) and missing keys
(`recNum` defaults). Event models, sources and the transport model take part as soon as they
implement the hooks; other parts are listed in `ProfileModel.checkpointParts`.

## Rules

- **State vector**: histories and rewinds index `y` by position. Append to `SCALAR_NAMES` only
  when a quantity must be integrated with the step; it changes `nState` and every 1.5D golden file.
- **Work arrays**: add names to `CELL_ARRAYS` / `FACE_ARRAYS` in `work.ts`; avoid allocating
  inside the Picard loop.
- **Geometry**: anything derived from the transport geometry is rebuilt through `ctx.onGeometry`
  or `geometryChanged`; an equilibrium swap mid-shot is followed by `evaluateWorkArrays`.
- **Determinism**: randomness only through `ctx.rng` (checkpointed); no wall clock, no iteration
  over unordered containers in the physics; fixed evaluation and summation order.
- **Diagnostics**: new keys go through `writeDiagnostics` (and `stateDiagnostics` for frames no step
  produced); add a `DiagSpec` to `PROFILE_DIAGS` only for traces the UI and figures should show.
  The golden files record every key of every frame: a new key or a moved number needs
  `npm run golden:update -- --reason "…"`.
- **Units**: T in keV, n in m⁻³, power densities in W m⁻³ (heat-equation sources in
  keV m⁻³ s⁻¹), ψ in Wb/rad increasing outwards, fluxes through a surface in 1/s or keV/s,
  outwards positive.

## Known limitations

- `ProfileModules.events` only adds event models (before the disruption check); the standard ones,
  in particular `ELM` (its statistics go into the report) and `sawtooth`, are replaced by
  editing `defaultEvents()`. Sources and the transport model can be replaced.
- The `accepted` hooks and the checkpoints of sources and the transport model run in the normal
  phase; during the quench phases of a disruption profiles are scaled, not transported.
- The stored energy is summed in two places (`acceptStep` as W_e + W_i, `ctx.storedEnergy` for
  frames no step produced and the quench); they agree to rounding only.
- `ProfileModel` still carries the `rhs`/`integratorOpts` stub that `SimModel` requires, although
  it advances with `step()` only.
- `'cgm'` is uncalibrated; its outermost face uses the gradient between the last two cells, not
  the one to the separatrix value, and it is slow on JET-size machines.
- P_SOL (two-point T_sep) follows the lagged global balance P_heat − P_rad − dW/dt, not P_bound, on
  purpose: the instantaneous flux would couple T_sep and the edge gradient step by step.

## Tests

| File | Covers |
| --- | --- |
| `modules.test.ts` | state layout, work arrays, module wiring, checkpoint keys, the three plug-in interfaces (hooks and their call counts, particle source, state over accepted steps and rewinds) |
| `events/events.test.ts` | every event model through `afterStep`, with checkpoints |
| `energy.test.ts` | convection vs an analytic steady state, exact energy identity of a heat step, full-model energy balance (ITER15) |
| `geometry.test.ts` | transport geometry of an analytic Solov'ev equilibrium |
| `sources/sources.test.ts` | NBI chord cache vs direct deposition, beam-target table vs the integral |
| `transport/transport.test.ts` | 'cgm' smoke test (ITER15 ramp-up) |
| `integrity.test.ts` | equilibrium swaps (fresh work arrays), GS failures and retry timing, step failures, reported τ_E, initial equilibrium, replays from quench frames |
| `profiles.test.ts` | solver verification (analytic), neoclassical, MHD helpers, integration runs |

A change meant to preserve behaviour should leave `npm run golden` passing; a refactor can be
checked bit for bit by hashing whole histories before and after (every frame's `y`, diagnostics,
profiles, checkpoint record, and the events).
